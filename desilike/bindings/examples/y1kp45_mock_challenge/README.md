# y1kp45_mock_challenge bindings

To generate bindings, just run:
```
python full_shape.py
```
which creates cobaya_bindings/, cosmosis_bindings/ and montepython_bindings/ directories with likelihood bindings specific to each of the inference codes;
look at the README in these directories for indications on how to import the generated likelihoods.
