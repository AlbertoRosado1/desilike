# y1kp45_mock_challenge bindings

To generate bindings, just run:
```
python full_shape.py
```
which creates cobaya/, cosmosis/ and montepython/ directories with likelihood bindings specific to each of these inference codes;
look at the README in these directories for indications on how to import the generated likelihoods.
