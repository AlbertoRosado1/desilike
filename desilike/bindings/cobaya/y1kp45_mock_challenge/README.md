# y1kp45_mock_challenge

After installing cobaya, add the automatically-generated desilike likelihood in Cobaya's *.yaml file
(imported as desilike.bindings.cobaya.y1kp45_mock_challenge.LikelihoodName).
Then you should be able to run e.g.:
```
cobaya-run config_AbacusSummitLRGFullPowerSpectrumMultipoles.yaml
```
config_* files are hand-written; all others are automatically generated.
